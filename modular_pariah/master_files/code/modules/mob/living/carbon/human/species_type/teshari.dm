		However, much like the space-fable of the space-tortoise and space-hare, lizards have rejected their kin's motto of \"slow and steady\" \
		in favor of resting on their laurels and getting completely surpassed by 'bald apes', due in no small part to their lack of access to plasma.",

		with the finale being an explosive remodeling of their moon. Today's lizard-human relations are seeing the continuance of a record period of peace.",

		"Lizard culture is inherently militaristic, though the influence the military has on lizard culture \
		begins to lessen the further colonies lie from their homeworld - \
		with some distanced colonies finding themselves subsumed by the cultural practices of other species nearby.",

		"On their homeworld, lizards celebrate their 16th birthday by enrolling in a mandatory 5 year military tour of duty. \
		Roles range from combat to civil service and everything in between. As the old slogan goes: \"Your place will be found!\"",
